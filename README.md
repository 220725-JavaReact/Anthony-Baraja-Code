## Introduction
My passion for Software Development started with my childhood memories with Video Games, then moving on to Mobile Development during and after college.
Joined Revature to continue my journey as Software Engineer, my current Tech Stack is Java/Mulesoft, as a result I have backend knowledge.
I look forward to learning REACT and Full Stack in general.
